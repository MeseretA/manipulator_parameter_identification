# Parameter_ID

This repo contains code for determining regressor matrix for systematic parameter identification of robots.

Dependencies

    DART - 
    Dart is an open source physics engine for simulating articulated rigid bodies with high accuracy and efficiency and PyDart2 is a python binding of Dart. To install Dart, please follow the below instructions:
    
    Prerequisites for Ubuntu

    Usage

    In order to run with a simulation, follow instructions in 41-krang-sim-ach to launch the ach channels and processes required before this program is run. Then in the build folder of this repo, type:
  
    sudo ./Get_phi_ArmDynamics <train/test.

    Please use either train or test to run algorithm on training or testing data
